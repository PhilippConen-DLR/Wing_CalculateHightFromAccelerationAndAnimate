# Wing_CalculateHightFromAccelerationAndAnimate
This program calculates pitch & roll from acceleration data. With the information about the angles and widths a difference in heigth is calculated. Afterward, the change of heigth is animated over time.

Attention: This program requires a file "GyroCalibration.csv" which contains the offsets of the MPU6050 (angles) in rest position. Use "Wing_GyroCalibration" program or create a file by yourself.
